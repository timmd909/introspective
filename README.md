# Introspective

This library aims to provide a convinient and efficient way to extract structured,
arbitrary class metadata from any given PHP codebase.  The main driver behind
features is supplying this information to code completion plugins for various
editors.

This package is in super early development and will make backwards incompatible
changes frequently.
